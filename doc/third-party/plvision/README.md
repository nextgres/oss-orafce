# PL/Vision Library Compatibility

Originally developed by well-known PL/SQL expert Steven Feuerstein, PL/Vision was a collection of PL/SQL packages and supporting SQL\*Plus scripts that aided developers in buildling applications with the PL/SQL language. This extension includes a subset of this library ported to Postgres.
